## Disclaimer

Since frameworks aren't allowed, I had to make decisions about how much I was going
to write myself and what was going to be out of scope. This is a list of things I
left out of scope, because they don't seem to be the focus of the exercise.

- I didn't properly escape output in the templates.
- I didn't build an MVC engine, so the controlling is done at the top of the views.
- I didn't build an ORM, but I made a system with repositories and read models.
- I didn't build an environment variables system to keep the db connection details outside git.
- The pages are minimally styled and ugly. I focused on functionality only.
